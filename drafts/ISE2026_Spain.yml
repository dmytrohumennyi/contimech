    We are working on a robot manipulator project for an auto-verification workflow on the shop floor.
    The robot must communicate with production workers (non-developers) who are on shift at the same time
    as the robot, and the most natural interface is real-time voice interaction.

    Technically, our voice loop is: mic → speech-to-text (ASR) → LLM intent parsing → robot command / spoken feedback.
    In a demo setup, we observe up to ~4 seconds end-to-end latency, mostly around the ASR/LLM stage.
    This is acceptable for conversation, but noticeable when coordinating actions with a moving robot.

    At ISE 2026 in Barcelona, we had a great technical discussion with ASUS about edge AI for robotics.
    ASUS materials for ISE highlight compact NUC platforms with "up to 180 platform TOPS" (as stated by ASUS),
    and we are interested in validating what this means for stable, low-latency inference in robotics pipelines
    (ROS 2 + OpenCV + Llama-based command interpretation).

    Congrats to ASUS on a strong presence at ISE — see you again.
